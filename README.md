# Please-give-papers

We've created a mod for a game that is heavily inspired by "Papers Please" on Unity3D game engine for a game jam. Unfortunately, due to real-life problems they couldn't finish it on time.
we used it tu create this short game.

most of the 2D assets are our not our work. Character portraits are created by emirshn.
